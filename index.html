    <h1>Electrolysis</h1>

    <h2>Intro</h2>

    <p>Electrolysis breaks down substances using electricity. That's literally it.</p>

    <p>Electrolysis is used in a lot of places. It's how we make aluminium for phones,
    hydrogen for fuel cells, and chlorine for swimming pools!</p>

    <p>Most explanations have two sections: 1) definitions, and 2) setting up the
    practical. But I think this makes things confusing. Understanding electrolysis is all
    about understanding <i> the practical </i>. So, we're going to set up the practical step by
    step, very slowly, and only introduce definitions when we need to. </p>

    <p>This explanation is longer than the one in the CGP book for a good reason. After 6
    A-Levels and 3 years of University, I can say with confidence that the number one time
    waster while learning is being <i>confused</i>. With a longer explanation, I can add
    more detail, answer common questions, and give you review questions.</p>

    <p>In other words, a longer explanation helps me explain better to you, and review
    questions make sure you don't fall behind! Without review questions, you might straddle
    on and later get really confused. We want to avoid that at all cost.</p>

    <h2>Part 1: Dip A Circuit In Liquid</h2>

    <p>To make electrolysis occur so that we can break down a substance, we are going to
    make an unusual circuit and dip it in a liquid called an <i>electrolyte</i>.

    Trust me that later when we learn how the substances break down and move around the
    liquid, it'll make sense why we're doing this whole dipping circuit thing in the first place.

    <p>An electrolyte is a name for something that conducts electricity when in a liquid.
    The electrolyte can either be a <ol> <li>molten ionic compound (molten = melted into a
    liquid)</li> <li>ionic compound dissolved in water</li> </ol></p>

    <p> Why ionic compound? If it's an ionic compound, it contains ions that can move around
    when melted or dissolved in water. Electricity is just the "flow of ions". That's why
    electrolytes can conduct electricity! </p>

    <p>Ok, explanation over. Let's explain the first step of the practical. The first step is to fill a beaker with your electrolyte:</p>

    <p>Let's review what we've learnt so far. Please indulge me by answering the
    questions just below. It'll only take a few seconds â€“ for each question, think about
    what you believe the answer to be, click to reveal the actual answer, and then mark
    whether you remembered or not. If you can recall, that's great. If not, that's also
    fine, just note the correct answer, and continue.</p>
