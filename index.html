    <h1>Electrolysis</h1>

    <h2>Intro</h2>

    <p>Electrolysis breaks down substances using electricity. That's literally it.</p>

    <p>It's how we make aluminium for phones, chlorine for swimming pools, and []!</p>

    <p>Most explanations have two sections: 1. definitions and 2. setting up the
    practical, but I believe this makes it confusing. Understanding electrolysis is all
    about understanding the practical. So, we're going to set up the practical step by
    step, very slowly. </p>

    <p>This explanation is longer than the one in the CGP book for a reason. After 5 books
    on learning, 6 A-Levels, and 3 years of University, I can say that the #1 waste of
    time when learning is being <i>confused</i>. With a longer explanation, I can add more
    detail, answer common questions, and review questions.</p>

    <p>In other words, a longer explanation helps me explain better to you, and review
    questions make sure you're not behind! Without review questions, you might straddle
    on, not knowing you missed some important detail</p>

    <p>Understanding electrolysis is all about understanding the practical, so we're going to go over all the bits and bobs of the practical very slowly. It'll be a
    bit of a drag, but if you can memorise how to setup the practical, then you've got it. </p>

    <h2>Part 1</h2>
    <p>Let's setup the circuit we need to make electrolysis occur.</p>

    <p>The circuit we're making is dipped in a liquid. So we first fill a beaker with an electrolyte liquid of our choice. An electrolyte is a name for something that conducts electricity when in a liquid. The electrolyte can either be molten (melted into a liquid) or dissolved in water. Either way, it conducts electricity.</p>

    <p>We use a liquid instead of a solid or a gas because electricity is the flow of ions, and it's much easier to have a flow of ions that create electricity in a liquid than in a solid or a gas.</p>

    <p>In part 2 we'll explain how different kinds of electrolytes can produce different substances via electrolysis. But for now, all you have to remember is that we need a liquid that conducts electricity called an electrolyte.</p>

    <p>Ok, let's review what we've learnt so far. Please indulge me by answering the questions just below. It'll only take a few seconds â€“ for each question, think about what you believe the answer to be, click to reveal the actual answer, and then mark whether you remembered or not. If you can recall, that's great. If not, that's also fine, just note the correct answer, and continue.</p>
